* Andrew Schwartzmeyer's Emacs Configurations
Uses [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]] for package installation management. Primarily uses
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][jwiegley's use-package]] macro to cleanly and quickly require and setup
various packages. Enables lots of lovely minor modes, and
conditionally loads operating and local system specific code.

* Tricks and tips
** Using quote marks within verbatim/code markup in org-mode
- Unicode: <U200B> /xe2/x80/x8b ZERO WIDTH SPACE
- Insert using: (C-x 8 RET 200b RET)
** Sudo mode using Tramp
- http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode
- C-x C-f /ssh:you@remotehost|sudo:remotehost:/path/to/file RET
** Replace in files
From [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/271136][StackOverflow]]:

1. M-x find-name-dired: you will be prompted for a root directory and
   a filename pattern.

2. Press t to "toggle mark" for all files found.

3. Press Q for "Query-Replace in Files...": you will be prompted for
   query/substitution regexps.

4. Proceed as with query-replace-regexp: SPACE to replace and move to
   next match, n to skip a match, etc.

** Replace with capture
- use regex groups like "ab\(c\)" where the parentheses are escaped
  because Emacs
- refer to prior capture groups by \N where N is 1-indexed on the
  captured groups (e.g. back reference)
** Renumber with regexp
- see [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RenumberList][Wiki]]; the comma indicates elisp code to evaluate
- e.g. [0-9]+ -> \,(+ 257 \#)
** Projectile commands
- switch :: p
- make :: c
- test :: P
- replace :: r
- dired :: D
- vcs :: v
- ag :: ss
** ansi-term
- Needs [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/8920373][terminfo]]
- Remove TERM from shell's rc file
#+begin_src sh
tic -o ~/.terminfo
/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/share/emacs/24.4.50/etc/e/eterm-color.ti
#+end_src

** Quoting characters (C-q)
- newline :: C-j
** Find package code =find-library=
** Partially evaluate list elements
- (add-to-list 'somelist `(symbol . ,(expression to be evaluated)))
- The backquote is like a normal quote except it evaluates elements
  marked with commas. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html][RTFM]]
